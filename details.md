## PowerSync Introduction

[PowerSync](https://powersync.com) keeps backend databases in sync with on-device SQLite databases embedded in a client SDK. It enables instantly-responsive local-first & offline-first apps that remain available even when network connectivity is poor or non-existent. 

PowerSync is designed to be backend database agnostic, with support for Postgres, MongoDB, and MySQL as of April 2025.

PowerSync is also designed to be client-side framework agnostic, and offers a wide range of client SDKs, including Flutter, React Native & Expo, web (JavaScript), Node.js, Kotlin Multiplatform, Swift and .NET.

## The Story

PowerSync is a product of JourneyApps, a software company headquartered in Denver, Colorado. The original product of JourneyApps was the JourneyApps Platform, a full-stack app platform focused on industrial companies, with a sync engine as a subcomponent (originally also named PowerSync).

The PowerSync engine in the JourneyApps Platform has been used for years in production by a range of Fortune 500 customers in industries such as manufacturing, mining, energy and others. These customers typically have a need to sync a high volume of relational data to users in harsh field conditions, such as remote locations where users are frequently offline. Usage in these kinds of demanding environments has led JourneyApps to battle-harden the PowerSync engine over several years, and these customers continue to rely on the PowerSync engine for critical daily business operations.

In 2022, JourneyApps decided to spin off the PowerSync engine into the standalone PowerSync product (consisting of a sync service and SDK) allowing the creation of offline-first apps that sync data from backend databases to local SQLite on-device databases.
